# Webpack 4 Basics

Two simple Webpack projects based on Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's online Webpack video tutorials called: 

* [*What is Webpack, how does it work?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2T7k9NfI)
* [*Using the Webpack dev server*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRt0lODCQM)
* [*The Webpack core concepts*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DDVr6wjJzQ)
* [*Basic Babel and SCSS workflow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vnkM8JgjpU)
* [*HTML and image loaders*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzLiXgRUt4g)

The original Webpack 2 projects were modified to work with Webpack 4.
