# Webpack 4 Basics

Two simple Webpack projects based on Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's online Webpack video tutorials called: 

* [*WHAT IS WEBPACK, HOW DOES IT WORK?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2T7k9NfI)
* [*USING THE WEBPACK DEV SERVER*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRt0lODCQM)
* [*THE WEBPACK CORE CONCEPTS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DDVr6wjJzQ)
* [*BASIC BABEL + SCSS WORKFLOW*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vnkM8JgjpU)
* [*HTML + IMAGE LOADERS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzLiXgRUt4g)

The original Webpack 2 projects have been modified to work with Webpack 4.
