# Webpack 4 Basics: Babel, SCSS, HTML and image loaders

A simple Webpack project based on Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's online Webpack video tutorials called: 

* [*BASIC BABEL + SCSS WORKFLOW*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vnkM8JgjpU)
* [*HTML + IMAGE LOADERS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzLiXgRUt4g)

The original Webpack 2 project has been modified to work with Webpack 4.
