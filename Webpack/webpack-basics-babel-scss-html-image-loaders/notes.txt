- Don't need to add the JavaScript .js extention when importing a JS file because webpack already understands this.
- The extension and leading underscore is omitted when importing SCSS files. SCSS knows how to handle the import!
- The path variable is automatically included as part of npm.
- __dirname is the variable to the absolute path of the current directory.
- Add index.html to the src folder so that it may be included as part of bundle.js. Use the HTMLWebpackPlugin to tell webpack to use the index.html file as template.
