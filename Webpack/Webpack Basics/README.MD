A simple Webpack project based on Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's online Webpack video tutorials called: 

* [*WHAT IS WEBPACK, HOW DOES IT WORK?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2T7k9NfI)
* [*USING THE WEBPACK DEV SERVER*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNRt0lODCQM)
* [*THE WEBPACK CORE CONCEPTS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DDVr6wjJzQ)

The original Webpack 2 project was modified to work with Webpack 4.

Install the following npm packages:
* `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli` (webpack, webpack dev server + webpack cli)
* `npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader` (css and style loaders)
